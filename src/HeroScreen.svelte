    // 1) Every 2-5 seconds, pick a random command from 'commands'
    // 2) Type out the chosen command at a rate of 1 character every 0.1 seconds. The line where we type the character should start with 'C:\Users\coles>', which should also be added to history so it can be rendered.
    // 3) Add value of chosen command key to history on a new line.

    // Additional rules:
    // If 'clear' is picked, clear the screen, set history to empty, leaving only a 'C:\Users\coles>' and blinking caret remaining

    // This is just a simulation of a Windows console; you know how it should work and look...
